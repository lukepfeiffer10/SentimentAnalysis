					<h2>1.1 Project Objectives</h2>
						<p>This project will develop a system to construct a tagged sentiment analysis corpus for researchers. This will be done through a crowd sourced initiative which allows writers and other users to upload writing samples and view its sentiment structure in exchange for helping tag other stories in the system.</p>
					<h2>1.2 Application Domain and Related Work</h2>
						<h3>1.2.1 Sentiment Analysis Research</h3>
							<p>Sentiment Analysis (SA), as a field, tends to focus on opinion mining from product reviews and twitter posts. However, this field also encompasses the process of identifying the sentiments present in a piece of text (7, ,8). Our project focuses on the latter form of SA, because our project focuses on identifying the sentiment embedded in the text rather than identifying particular opinions. Our textual dataset will consist of stories, and focuses on being able to generate sentiment structures from those stories for user review. We intend to primarily use the process described in reference 4 for the sentiment structure construction.</p>
							<p>Bag of words is a common SA construction for making sentiment determinations. In 6, Dinakar examines a dataset of 5,500 stories from distressed teenagers using the latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) (4). The LDA generated themes were then used to match stories with similar themes that could then be presented to the teenager poster. This was done with the hope that the teenager would find comfort in reading a story depicting similar experiences. </p>
							<p>The Lexical Inquiry Word Counter (LIWC) is a text analysis tool that employs the bag of words methodology using a set of trained dictionaries. The LIWC dataset is unique in particular because its trained dictionaries are comprised of linguistically determined commonly used words, which are therefore more resistant to sentiment change over time than other word sets (1). Because it also includes categories for positive and negative words, it can be used as a sentiment analysis tool (9, 10, 13). LIWC has been used on both smaller as well as larger datasets. An example of LIWC being employed on a larger dataset was when it was ran on the entirety of google books and sorted by time. The results of this study are shown on the right. Needless to say, LIWC correctly assigned emotions expected to be prevalent in different decades. Most notable is the spike of positive emotion in the roaring 1920s followed by the drop to extreme negative emotion in the 1930s depression (1). LIWC has also been used on smaller datasets with success, such as the study on word use in the poetry of suicidal and nonsuicidal poets in citation 13.</p>
							<p>SentiWordNet is a sentiment analysis tool that contains a dictionaries tagged words to be used in sentiment analysis. It contains a wider dataset than LIWC. It also allows for an objectivity--or neutrality--fact to be included in the sentiment data. However, with this larger dataset comes a decline in accuracy; not all of the words in SentiWordNet are human tagged. Only 1000 words are human tagged, and the rest are derived from predefined WordNet sysnet connection(2). </p>
							<p>The NLTK sentiment analysis tool also employs the bag of words methodology using a naive bayes classifier. Although NLTK includes trained classifiers on both twitter sentiment and movie reviews from data sets created by Bo Pang and Lillian Lee, it is possible to use the classifier with your own dataset for training (10).</p>
							<p>However, the bag of words methodology, even augmented with statistical classifiers, can fail to retain accuracy in different textual contexts, grammar in longer textual instances, and different textual formats. An example of textual context interfering with correct analysis in accordance with the bag of words model would be the usage of LIWC to analyze post 9/11 sentiment reactions. An initial usage of LIWC to analyze the 9/11 reactions indicated that people were angry about the situation. However,  this analysis was entirely due to the usage of the word “critical”, identified as a word indicating anger, being re-tweeted. In this context the word meant “urgent” and wasn’t necessarily an indication that people were, in fact, angry at the current situation (12). Grammar in longer textual instances is also a factor in accuracy retention with SA. Some of the reasons cited for this inaccuracy is that word and sentence order becomes increasingly important, as well as the presence of conjunctions and negations. This is a problem addressed by Socher and other authors associated with citation 13 through the development of the Recursive Neural Tensor Network. This research was conducted on a trained corpus of fully labeled and fully parsed movie reviews. The text was parsed into binary trees, with the sentiment of parent nodes computed bottom up from the leaf node word instances. Different textual formats is also a factor in SA accuracy. As shown by citations 3 and 4, understanding how SA operated in different textual formats in an important field of study for both national security as well as social movement data generation. The research conducted by Chundi and others in citation 4 indicates that different methodologies are required to analyze stories versus other works. As initially postulated by April Corbet for the 2014 Summer FUSE grant, because stories include a temporal format--a beginning, a middle, and an end--different methodologies are necessary to properly analyze these stories. Typically, the overall sentiment of a work is used to determine the sentiment of the text. To determine positive stories from the street harassment dataset, a sentiment structure was developed to identify the way the sentiments changed as a function of time. It was determined that the overall sentiment of a story--whether a story was positive or negative--could be determined by the end cluster of the story, rather than as a function of all the story’s sentiment. </p>
							<p>It is the sentiment structure developed in citation 4 research that will be used as the primary root of this project. Demos and APIs of SentiWordNet, NLTK, and other sentiment analysis tools are the closest to our project currently in existence. However, they focus on making the tool for a research audience, and generally focus on determining an overall sentiment of the text rather than meaning to be used as a tool for analyzing sentiment as stories. They also don’t show the sentiment structure of the work as a whole. </p>
							<p>So, the story format is a unique format worth studying that is currently not being focused on by researchers in the sentiment analysis field as a whole, and as such there are currently no sentiment analysis tools that focus primarily on analyzing text in a story format. The current corpus in this field reflects its focus on shorter text segments that aren't probably in a story format, and tend to be movie reviews and twitter posts. The development of a corpus for stories for sentiment analysis would provide a plethora of more data for story research for sentiment analysis, and would significantly benefit this field.</p>
						<h3>1.2.2 The Writer User Base and Story Development and Analysis</h3>
							<p>There is currently a wide internet writer user base. According to the Nanowrimo 2012 statistics--an online yearly program where writers try to writer a novel during national novel writing month--included 341,375 participants and its young writers and educators program included 82,554 participants (http://nanowrimo.org/). Fanfiction, the process of writing works based off of other works, enjoys similar online participation. The fanfiction archive site fanfiction.net includes 6,085,534 online works as of 6/5/2010, and the archive site archiveofourown.org contains 1,024,824 works as of 3/7/2014 (https://www.fanfiction.net/, https://archiveofourown.org/ ). So, there is a wide array of online participation for writers.</p>
							<p>This online onslaught of writers includes the cropping up of various online tools to aid in the writing process. This includes tools such as the writing apps Writing Prompts, Writer, Write Now, and Power Writer as well as the software Scrivener, Storybook, and FocusWriter (https://itunes.apple.com/, http://literatureandlatte.com/, http://storybook.en.softonic.com/, http://focuswriter.en.softonic.com/).</p>
							<p>However, currently writers and story analysts don’t look at how the sentiment structure of a story, separate from the story plot, informs information about the story. The reason for this is because sentiment in text is usually thought about in terms of a particular character’s sentiment or the connotations behind words rather than a separate entity in and of itself. This is evident in On Writing Well by William Zinsser as well as pervasive throughout both the writing and literary analysis fields (15). Because a sentiment structure can inform a piece in the same way that plot can, knowing the sentiment structure of a story can be a valuable tool in both editing and story analysis. Because of the gaps between these fields as well as the fact that SA is currently an emerging field, this sort of tool doesn’t have anything similar in terms of writing applications but at the same time would be a useful tool.</p>
