                But, you may ask, what is the Sentiment Structure Project and how does it help me as a writer?
                We're so happy you asked.
                Imagine this. You've just read The Lord of the Rings for the third time and are now languishing in front of your blank screen, your fingers paralyzed because you can't seem to rise to Tolkien's genius. On top of that, your cat adds her character kjlkjljlgjkjl to your story as she claims the keyboard as her heating pad.  
                Fear not! Sentiment Structure Project is here. Simply put in a sentence or paragraph from Tolkien's book, then copy and paste the sentence or paragraph from your story that you want to compare with the great fantasy author. The software will analyze the two writing styles using sentiment structure, which searches for keywords and phrases in text. This will not turn you into Tolkien (that technology has yet to be invented, though we are looking into it) but will show you how to craft your sentence or story with more of his style of writing, training your eye to see how the greats' minds worked.
                Don't be too hasty to delete kjlkjljlgjkjl. Your cat's character matches Golem's hairball coughing. We'll have to analyze this some more.
